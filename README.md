# Project 01131501
## By BreezyAutum
### Latest Update: V1.0
- Calculator V1.0 released
- Latest Update section added to README.md
-- You're here now :D
- Upaded Ideas.txt
- General README updates, mostly currently working on section
- Removed How to Download from README. If you're downloading a random student's project, I'm going to assume you have some Git experience. There are also tutorials on this.
- Added Flowchart.xml although it is in very early construction
- Updated Goals

### Goals
This is a work in progress project that I hope to:
- Learn how to create various simple programs
- Update an ongoing project with new programs
-- As well as update previously created programs with new features to either imrpove them in terms of functionality, design, or optimization.
- Gain a better understanding of Python and GitHub
-- Expandable to other languages and prototypes as well
- Have something neat I can show I made
- Host this on a custom website I make
- Create a linking central hub for each program to launch from and launch after closing

### This is a project BY me FOR me... but you can use it too!
I am working on this project on my own time outside of classes; therefore I have no idea how often I can or will update this project. Class work comes before side work.
This project is for me and me alone, but if you are some who is not me reading this:
- Firstly, Hello!!! Thank you for checking out my project!
- Secondly, if you have any ideas or feedback, please do write it on the GitHub page.
- Thirdly, I'm going at this with the idea that I'll be the only one using this, but I know other people can still see it. This means that I am not expecting anyone other than me to realistically read these notes. If somehow that isn't the case, I'll probably ignore that fact anyway.
- Lastly, despite how I am personally using this project, if you are in fact another human reading this, you may use it for your own use with some minor exceptions:
-- Do not use this for AI training AT ALL
-- Do not use this for your class work or job work AT ALL
-- You, yourself, may use it, but I hope that I made it clear that while you can use and mess around with this project, Keep it casual and on your own time.

### Currently Working On:
- Calculator
-- After completeing a calculation, give the option to go through the program again
- README
-- (What you are currently reading)
-- Learn how to use Markdown better so I can properly format this file and all other READMEs I will eventually have to make.
- Git
-- I've had some issues with Git, GitHub, and VS Code while even in class, so bear with me while I am still learning all of this.
- Python
-- I took an Introduction to Python class years ago in high school. The class did not cover much at all, but I still enjoyed it and led me to here. That said, it has been quite a while since I've used Python, so I will need to review. There's still a lot for me to learn as well.

### Closing Remarks
Thank you for checking out my project! I hope to update it soon! I have lots of plans for this little project.
