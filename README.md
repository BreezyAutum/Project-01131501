# Project 01131501
## By BreezyAutum

### Goals
This is a work in progress project that I hope to:
- Learn how to create various simple programs
- Update an ongoing project with new programs
-- As well as update previously created programs with new features to either imrpove them in terms of functionality, design, or optimization.
- Gain a better understanding of Python and GitHub
-- Exlandable to other languages and prototypes as well
- Have something neat I can show I made

### This is a project BY me FOR me... but you can use it too!
I am working on this project on my own time outside of classes; therefore I have no idea how often I can or will update this project. Class work comes before side work.
This project is for me and me alone, but if you are some who is not me reading this:
- Firstly, Hello!!! Thank you for checking out my project!
- Secondly, if you have any ideas or feedback, please do write it on the GitHub page.
- Thirdly, I'm going at this with the idea that I'll be the only one using this, but I know other people can still see it. This means that I am not expecting anyone other than me to realistically read these notes. If somehow that isn't the case, I'll probably ignore that fact anyway.
- Lastly, despite how I am personally using this project, if you are in fact another human reading this, you may use it for your own use with some minor exceptions:
-- Do not use this for AI training AT ALL
-- Do not use this for your class work or job work AT ALL
-- You, yourself, may use it, but I hope that I made it clear that while you can use and mess around with this project, Keep it casual and on your own time.

### How to Download
Either unknown, unavailable, or it's completely possible but I personally wouldn't recommend it. Nothing is finished yet. The calculator is still in its first write up, and I haven't even finished THAT yet.

### Currently Working On:
- Calculator
-- General setup and code
- README
-- (What you are currently reading)
-- This is the first draft, so I will probably have to edit it or, more likely, format my text differently.
- Git
-- I've had some issues with Git, GitHub, and VS Code while even in class, so bear with me while I am still learning all of this.
- Python
-- I took an Introduction to Python class years ago in high school. The class did not cover much at all, but I still enjoyed it and led me to here. That said, it has been quite a while since I've used Python, so I will need to review. There's still a lot for me to learn as well.

### Closing Remarks
Thank you for checking out my project! I hope to update it soon!
