<h2>GH-V0.1 - Armadillo in KISS Makeup Edition</h2>
<h3>Welcome to the website!</h3>
<p>Thank you for checking out this page. Currently, this is just the Github build version. Someday, I'll have this properly hosted. In the meantime, Github will work just fine. This page is going to be fun to look back on for me. I'm starting this while still attending my Web Development 1 and Object Orientated Programming classes. That's right! Term 1 baby!<br><br>While nothing has been added yet, in the future there will be a good few things... such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Links to various projects I make</li>
  <li>Blog posts</li>
  <li>Cool thngs I want to share</li>
  <li>AND SO MUCH MORE... but I can't think of anything else right now</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't added much of anything to this site yet because I want to look back on al of this someday, and see how little I actually had under my belt. I also still want to share it even thought it's not done, and I have to get home from school.<br><br><br><br><br> The Armadillo in KISS Makeup thing is a reference to <a href = "https://youtu.be/vP1a4wEJr1U?si=orVhDkOYtmJ1TpXP"><em>Neverending Hum</em> by Lemon Demon</a></p>
